A personal design system with DNA in its name — **Gene** + **UI/UX** = **Genuix** (sounds like "genuine-x").

Also a place to document my findings of building a design system.

## Motivation

- Learn how design systems are built and maintained.
- Explore UI/UX best practices hands-on.
- Build personal libraries to use across my projects.
